# Project 3: Automate me!

## Objective

Automate real-world incident response tasks.


## Assignment Description

In this project you are given the role of a security analyst. You are sent botnet alerts which refers to a notice claiming that some device in your organization was detected to communicate with a known sinkhole -- a network address used by malware. This means that some device in your network is potentially infected with malware. Your job is to identify the actual user (along with the MAC address of the device) within the organization that has potentially been infected. Problem is that your organization has tens of thousands of users and has the additional layer of indirection through NATed routers. This situation is simply crying out to you: AUTOMATE ME!
